Using a skin-safe marker, a set distance of 4.5 centimetres was measured from the carpal bones of the wrist, as this probe placement displayed the best view of the target muscles. 
The target point was marked to maintain a consistent distance during data collection. 
Ultrasound setup: 
> The Esaote Mylab 25 gold portable ultrasound 
>	Esaote LA435 linear probe
>	Frequency set at 18MHz
>	Depth at 4cm
Then, multiple images were taken while performing each hand gesture. 
After each gesture, it was reset by the participant relaxing their hand and then performing the gesture again. 
This cycle was repeated until at least 50 images were captured for each gesture. This process was performed for all of the hand gestures. 
Then, the data was sorted into individual folders corresponding to specific hand gestures and fed into MATLAB code to be cropped and grey-scaled (same code as used for online data). 
This resulted in labelled dataset of 245 images.
